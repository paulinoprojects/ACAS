### Introduction
Welcome to my personal ACAS documentation! This repository provides an overview of the Assured Compliance Assessment Solution (ACAS), a security tool suite for vulnerability scanning, compliance checking, and risk assessment. It is primarily used by govenerment agencies but can also be valuable for other organizations that need to assess and manage cybersecurity risks.

### Features
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Comprehensive checks for system vulnerabilities.
- **Compliance Checks**: Verifies adherence to NIST, DISA STIGs, and other standards.
- **Risk Assessment**: Provides risk scores to help prioritize remediation actions.
- **Asset Discovery**: Identifies devices within the network for security auditing.

### Getting Started
To get started with ACAS:
1. Install Nessus, SecurityCenter, and other components as per the provided installation guide.
2. Configure your network settings to integrate ACAS with your existing security infrastructure.
3. Set up vulnerability scans and compliance checks based on your organizational needs.
4. Review generated reports to identify and mitigate potential security risks.

### Contributing
While ACAS is primarily a DoD solution, if you are an authorized contributor working in a similar environment, you can help by improving documentation, updating vulnerability scan templates, or testing configurations.

### License
ACAS is a government-managed solution. If you wish to use it outside of a government or DoD environment, consult the licensing guidelines provided by the responsible agency.
