# ACAS Scan Guide
## Prerequisites
Before starting the scan, ensure that you have:
- Proper access to ACAS tools such as **Nessus** or **SecurityCenter**.
- Required permissions for scanning the target system.
- Understanding of the system or network architecture.
- A list of systems to be scanned, including IP addresses and hostnames.

## Steps for Conducting ACAS Scans

### Step 1: Log in to the ACAS System
1. Open your web browser.
2. Navigate to the **SecurityCenter** or **Nessus** interface (usually `https://<ACAS_IP>`).
3. Enter your credentials to log in to the ACAS portal.

### Step 2: Configure Scan Settings
1. In the ACAS dashboard, locate the **Scans** tab or section.
2. Click on **Create New Scan** or **New Scan** to start setting up the scan.
3. Choose a **scan template** based on the type of scan you wish to perform (e.g., Compliance, Vulnerability, or Full Scan).
4. Name your scan for easier identification (e.g., "Vulnerability Scan - <Target Name>").
5. Select the **scan type**:
   - **Basic Network Scan** (for standard vulnerability scanning)
   - **Compliance Scan** (for compliance with NIST, DISA STIGs, etc.)
   - **Advanced Scan** (for customized scanning)
   
### Step 3: Configure Target Systems
1. In the **Targets** field, enter the IP addresses or hostnames of the systems to be scanned.
2. If scanning multiple systems, you can upload a CSV file with a list of target IPs/hostnames.

### Step 4: Set Scan Credentials (Optional)
1. For more accurate and in-depth scanning, you may need to provide credentials for the systems being scanned.
   - Click on **Credentials** and input the username and password for the target systems.
   - Common credentials needed may include:
     - **Windows** credentials (admin/root)
     - **Linux/Unix** credentials
2. Make sure the credentials are entered correctly to avoid access issues during the scan.

### Step 5: Configure Scan Options
1. Review **scan options** such as the scan frequency (e.g., one-time, recurring) and scan window (specific time range).
2. Enable **notifications** if you want to receive alerts once the scan is complete or if any issues arise.
3. Select any additional **plug-ins** or settings based on the specific needs of your scan (e.g., scanning for particular vulnerabilities or compliance checks).

### Step 6: Launch the Scan
1. Once the scan settings are configured, click **Launch Scan** or **Start Scan** to initiate the process.
2. The scan will begin, and depending on the size of your target environment, it may take some time to complete.

### Step 7: Monitor the Scan Progress
1. After launching the scan, you can monitor the scan progress in real-time from the ACAS dashboard.
2. Review the **Scan Status** to ensure the scan is running correctly.
3. If the scan encounters any issues (e.g., timeout, missing credentials), it will be displayed in the logs.

### Step 8: Review Scan Results
1. Once the scan is completed, navigate to the **Results** section.
2. The results will typically include:
   - Vulnerability findings, categorized by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
   - Compliance status (e.g., whether the scanned system adheres to required security policies).
   - Recommendations and remediation steps.
3. Review each finding to assess the security risks and determine necessary remediation actions.

### Step 9: Generate Reports
1. You can generate a detailed **report** based on the scan results.
2. In the **Reports** tab, choose the **Scan Results** you want to report on.
3. Select the **Report Format** (PDF, HTML, CSV, etc.).
4. Customize the report content (e.g., only vulnerabilities, compliance issues, etc.).
5. Click **Generate Report** and save it to your local machine.

### Step 10: Remediate Identified Issues
1. Review the scan findings to identify critical vulnerabilities or compliance issues.
2. Prioritize remediation actions based on severity (e.g., patching critical vulnerabilities, applying security configuration changes).
3. Re-scan the systems after remediation to verify that the issues were resolved.

### Step 11: Schedule Regular Scans (Optional)
1. To maintain a continuous security posture, schedule periodic scans based on your organizationâ€™s policies.
2. In the scan configuration section, select **Recurring Scan** and set the frequency (e.g., weekly, monthly).
3. Review and adjust the scan configuration as needed for different systems or threat vectors.

## Troubleshooting
- **Scan Failed**: Ensure that the target system is accessible and that proper credentials are provided.
- **Slow Scan**: Reduce the scan scope or break it into smaller parts.
- **Permission Errors**: Ensure the scan credentials have the required privileges to access and assess the system.

## Conclusion
Running ACAS scans is an essential step in maintaining network security and compliance. By following these steps, you can identify vulnerabilities and ensure that systems are compliant with the necessary security standards.
