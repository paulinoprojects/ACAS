# Assured Compliance Assessment Solution (ACAS)

## Overview

ACAS (Assured Compliance Assessment Solution) is a suite of security tools used by the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) and other federal agencies to assess and ensure compliance with cybersecurity standards. It helps identify vulnerabilities, assess security configurations, and monitor compliance with various security requirements. ACAS is used for scanning networks, systems, and software to ensure compliance with policies such as the NIST SP 800-53 and other security controls.

## Components of ACAS

### 1. **Nessus**
   - The core vulnerability scanning tool used in ACAS. Nessus is an industry-standard tool that performs comprehensive scans for known vulnerabilities.

### 2. **SecurityCenter**
   - A centralized platform that manages the scans performed by Nessus and organizes the results. It provides a dashboard for analyzing vulnerabilities, risk assessments, and compliance reporting.

### 3. **PVS (Passive Vulnerability Scanner)**
   - A tool for continuously scanning a network passively (without actively probing systems) to detect vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.

### 4. **LCE (Log Correlation Engine)**
   - Collects and analyzes log data from across the network to provide insights into security events and assist with compliance reporting.

## Functions of ACAS

### 1. **Vulnerability Scanning**
   - ACAS scans networked devices to identify vulnerabilities, missing patches, misconfigurations, and weak security settings.

### 2. **Compliance Checking**
   - ACAS verifies systems' compliance with cybersecurity policies and regulations such as NIST, DISA STIGs, and other federal standards.

### 3. **Asset Discovery**
   - ACAS helps identify devices on the network, including hardware and software components that may be overlooked in security assessments.

### 4. **Reporting and Documentation**
   - ACAS generates detailed reports on scan results, security posture, and compliance status, which are used for audits and to guide remediation efforts.

### 5. **Risk Assessment**
   - ACAS provides risk scores for vulnerabilities, helping prioritize fixes based on severity and potential impact.

## Deployment & Configuration

- **Server/VM Requirements**: ACAS requires a dedicated server or virtual machine to run the SecurityCenter platform.
- **Nessus Deployment**: Nessus scanners are deployed on specific systems, while PVS is deployed across the network to continuously monitor devices.
- **Network Integration**: ACAS must be integrated with the DoDâ€™s network systems and must follow specific configuration and compliance policies.

## Usage in Security Operations

- ACAS is used to identify network weaknesses before attackers can exploit them.
- It is key for ensuring continuous compliance with DoD security standards.
- The tool is widely used in federal and critical infrastructure environments that require compliance with DoD policies.

## Integration with Other Tools

- ACAS can integrate with other security tools like SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) solutions to provide a comprehensive view of the network's security.
- It can be used alongside SCAP (Security Content Automation Protocol) for automated compliance checks.

## ACAS for Remediation

- After performing vulnerability scans, ACAS generates reports that help network administrators prioritize and remediate security issues.
- Remediation often includes patch management and system configuration changes.

## Limitations and Considerations

- **Scanning Impact**: ACAS scans can be resource-intensive, so scheduling and testing are necessary to avoid disruptions.
- **False Positives/Negatives**: As with all automated tools, there may be false positives or negatives, so human oversight is essential.
- **Scope**: ACAS is designed for DoD and federal compliance, and may not be as flexible in environments outside these frameworks.

## Training and Support

- Proper training is crucial for using ACAS effectively, including configuring scans, interpreting results, and applying the right compliance standards.
- Support is provided by Tenable (developer of Nessus) and DoD entities.
