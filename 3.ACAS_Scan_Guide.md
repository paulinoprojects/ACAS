# Easy Step-by-Step Guide for Conducting ACAS Scans

This guide is designed for new admins to conduct successful ACAS (Assured Compliance Assessment Solution) scans. Follow these instructions carefully for your first scan.

## What You Need to Know Before You Start
1. **What is ACAS?**  
   ACAS is a security tool that scans your systems for vulnerabilities and compliance issues.

2. **What Do You Need?**
   - ACAS access (SecurityCenter or Nessus).
   - Credentials for the systems you are scanning (username & password).
   - List of IPs or hostnames for the systems you want to scan.

## Step 1: Log In to ACAS System

1. Open your web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
2. In the address bar, type the IP address or URL for the ACAS system (e.g., `https://<ACAS_IP>`).
3. Enter your **username** and **password** on the login screen.
4. Click **Login** to access the ACAS dashboard.

## Step 2: Create a New Scan

1. **Find the Scans Section**: On the ACAS dashboard, look for the **Scans** tab or button (usually on the top or side).
2. Click on **Create New Scan** or **New Scan**.
3. **Choose a Scan Template**:
   - **Basic Network Scan** – Use this for general vulnerability scanning.
   - **Compliance Scan** – Use if you are checking for security compliance (e.g., NIST, DISA STIG).
   - **Advanced Scan** – If you need to customize the scan (for experienced users).
4. **Name the Scan**: Give your scan a unique name, like “Test Scan - <Target System Name>”.

## Step 3: Add Systems to Scan

1. **Enter Target Information**: 
   - In the **Targets** section, type the IP addresses or hostnames of the systems you want to scan.  
     Example: `192.168.1.1`, `192.168.1.2`, or `server-name.local`.
2. If you have a list of multiple systems, you can upload a CSV file that contains all the IPs or hostnames (this is optional).

## Step 4: Set Scan Credentials (Optional, but Recommended)

1. **Why Credentials?**: Credentials allow the scan to access systems deeper and provide more accurate results (like checking configuration settings).
2. **Add Credentials**:
   - **Windows Credentials**: Username and password for a system running Windows.
   - **Linux/Unix Credentials**: Username and password for Linux or Unix systems.
   - To add, click on **Credentials**, then input the **username** and **password**.
3. **Test Credentials** (Optional): If there’s a button to test the credentials, click it to ensure the credentials work.

## Step 5: Configure Scan Settings

1. **Select Scan Type**:
   - **Quick Scan** – Fast scan for common vulnerabilities.
   - **Full Scan** – Thorough scan for deeper vulnerabilities.
   - **Compliance Scan** – For checking system configurations against security standards.
2. **Scan Options**:
   - Leave the default settings unless you know specific configurations are required.
   - **Frequency**: You can choose to scan just once, or set it to repeat regularly (e.g., weekly).
   - **Scan Window**: Choose the time frame for the scan to run (e.g., during off-peak hours).
3. **Notifications**: Enable email notifications if you want to receive updates on scan progress or issues.

## Step 6: Start the Scan

1. **Launch the Scan**: 
   - Once everything is set up, click on **Launch Scan** or **Start Scan**.
   - The scan will begin, and it may take several minutes or longer, depending on how many systems you are scanning.
2. **Monitor Progress**:
   - Go back to the **Scans** tab and check the status of your scan.
   - If you see "Running", the scan is in progress. If it says "Completed", then the scan is finished.

## Step 7: Review Scan Results

1. **View Results**: Once the scan is done, you can view the results by going to the **Results** tab.
2. **Look for Issues**:
   - Vulnerabilities (e.g., outdated software, security weaknesses).
   - Compliance issues (e.g., missing security patches).
3. **Severity Levels**: Issues are ranked by severity:
   - **Critical** – Needs immediate attention.
   - **High** – Needs attention soon.
   - **Medium/Low** – Less urgent but should be fixed.

---

## Step 8: Generate a Report

1. **Generate a Report**: 
   - Go to the **Reports** section.
   - Choose the scan you just ran and click **Generate Report**.
   - Pick the report format (e.g., PDF or HTML).
   - Click **Generate**.
2. **Save the Report**: Once the report is ready, download and save it to your computer for further action or sharing with your team.

---

## Step 9: Remediate Issues

1. **Fix Critical Issues First**: Look for the most severe vulnerabilities or compliance failures in the report.
2. **Apply Patches/Configuration Changes**: Follow the remediation steps based on the recommendations in the scan report.
3. **Rescan**: After applying fixes, rerun the scan to ensure the issues have been resolved.

---

## Step 10: Schedule Regular Scans (Optional)

1. **Set Recurring Scans**: If needed, set up a schedule for automatic scans to keep track of system security.
   - Go back to the **Scan Settings** and select **Recurring Scan**.
   - Set the frequency (e.g., weekly, monthly) and click **Save**.

## Troubleshooting Tips

1. **Scan Not Starting?**: Ensure the target system is online and accessible. Check firewall settings.
2. **Scan Takes Too Long?**: Try scanning fewer systems or reduce the scan scope.
3. **Scan Fails?**: Check if you provided correct credentials and verify the target system’s accessibility.
